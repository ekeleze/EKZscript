# EKZscript
A console application that allows for the use of 9xCode and GoCode in one file through a toggle.

This app is still in very early testing phases, and the languages supported are reduementry and dont fully work yet.

## Usage

To run a file, open the run.bat file and type the path the file is at.
Files must be .ekz or .ekzscript for toggle support, however you can run .9xc files and .gexe or .goexe although those only use their respective languages.

## Bug reporting

If the bug is non-fatal (as in EKZscript is still usable) make a post on the issues tab of this repo.  
If the bug is fatal (it makes EKZscript impossible to use) message me with a ping in my server (https://discord.gg/JUGY58Wz).  
If you are a friend of mine, just DM me.

I will try to get back to all issues quicly, thanks.
